# Optimizing-Volmeter-built-using-FRDM-KL25Z-for-power

A program to measure the power consumed by FRDM-KL25Z is optimized for power,leveraging the different low power MCU configurations offered by the board.The supply voltage is sampled every 500ms and appropriate LED is flashed indicating the range in which measured voltage falls under.An energy model is built and studied after the implementation of each optimization.
